# Documentation index

One line per document. Start with the repository [README](../README.md); the design is in [ARCHITECTURE](../ARCHITECTURE.md), release notes in
[CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md), open work in [TODO](../TODO.md). Vendor-specific documents live in `nvidia/docs/` and `amd/` (see the
[ARCHITECTURE](../ARCHITECTURE.md) layout).
