// Exact parallel launches: the shadow of device memory a trial of one launch is run under, and its undo log
// (vgpu/memory.hpp, "exact parallel launches"; docs/exact-threads.md has the argument for why a trial that commits
// left the bits of the serial run).
//
// The shadow has two levels. A page state stands for 4 KiB of the device's address range [va_base_, high_water_va_):
//     0                 no block has touched the page
//     b + 1             block b has read in it; no other block has touched it; nothing is noted by word
//     kMany             more than one block has read in it, and none has written in it; nothing is noted by word
//     kWords            the page is noted by word (below), and every word says what was done to its bytes
//     kWordsCoarse      the same, after one block read in the page by page state and then wrote in it: its reads were
//                       not noted by word, so every word started as "read by that block" (more than it read)
// A page moves 0 -> one reader -> many readers by compare-and-swap, or 0 -> kWords (the first block that writes in it,
// or, where the trial's plan says by word, the first that touches it), or (its only reader, about to write) its own
// reader mark -> kWordsCoarse; kMany, kWords and kWordsCoarse are final. A write is only made in a page noted by word.
// So a page some block read by page state is written by no other block: that block would have to bring the page to a
// word state, which only the page's sole reader can do, and it fills the words with its own reader mark first.
//
// In a page noted by word, one 32-bit word stands for four bytes:
//     0                 no block has touched the bytes
//     b + 1             block b has read them, and no other block has touched them
//     kMany             more than one block has read them, and none has written them
//     kWrite | (b + 1)  block b has written them (and may have read them); no other block has touched them
// A word only moves up that list (0 -> one reader -> many readers; 0 or its own reader mark -> its writer), by
// compare-and-swap, and a block makes its access only after the page and the word allow it. So for any two blocks and
// any byte:
//   * both read it: nothing to tell apart;
//   * one writes it and the other reads or writes it: whichever came second to the page or to the word found a state
//     it may not enter, and stopped the trial BEFORE touching the byte.
// A stopped trial is undone from the bytes each block kept when it first wrote a word (it owned the word then, so
// what it kept is what the launch started with), and the launch is run again in order.
//
// A stop at a page state, or at a word of a kWordsCoarse page that says "read", may be the note's fault and not the
// kernel's (the page says more was read than was). Such a stop is marked coarse and names the allocation; the caller
// may run the trial again with that allocation noted by word from the start (SpecPlan), which is the exact note.
